ABSTRACT = {This paper analyzes the challenges and requirements of establishing energy data ecosystems (EDEs) as data-driven infrastructures that overcome the limitations of currently fragmented energy applications. It proposes a new data- and knowledge-driven approach for management and processing. This approach aims to extend the analytics services portfolio of various energy stakeholders and achieve two-way flows of electricity and information for optimized generation, distribution, and electricity consumption. The approach is based on semantic technologies to create knowledge-based systems that will aid machines in integrating and processing resources contextually and intelligently. Thus, a paradigm shift in the energy data value chain is proposed towards transparency and the responsible management of data and knowledge exchanged by the various stakeholders of an energy data space. The approach can contribute to innovative energy management and the adoption of new business models in future energy data spaces.},

However, we observe widely varying data quality ranging from extensively curated datasets to crowdsourced and extracted data of relatively low quality. In this article, we present the results of a systematic review of approaches for assessing the quality of LD. We gather existing approaches and analyze them qualitatively. In particular, we unify and formalize commonly used terminologies across papers related to data quality and provide a comprehensive list of 18 quality dimensions and 69 metrics. Additionally, we qualitatively analyze the 30 core approaches and 12 tools using a set of attributes. The aim of this article is to provide researchers and data curators a comprehensive understanding of existing work, thereby encouraging further experimentation and development of new approaches focused towards data quality, specifically for LD.},

abstract="The growing volume, variety and complexity of data being collected for scientific purposes presents challenges for data integration. For data to be truly useful, scientists need not only to be able to access it, but also be able to interpret and use it. Doing this requires semantic context. Semantic Data Integration is an active field of research, and this chapter describes the current challenges and how existing approaches are addressing them. The chapter then provides an overview of several active research areas within the semantic data integration field, including interactive and collaborative schema matching, integration of geospatial and biomedical data, and visualization of the data integration process. Finally, the need to move beyond the discovery of simple 1-to-1 equivalence matches to the identification of more complex relationships across datasets is presented and possible first steps in this direction are discussed.",

	scenarios based
	
	on the project testbeds. The main components proposed for the X-Media
	knowledge
	
	sharing system are specified and an implementation plan for the development
	of these components is presented. These comprise:
	
	- Cross-media annotation tools,

Knowledge of the biological role of such shared proteins in one organism can often be transferred to other organisms. The goal of the Gene Ontology Consortium is to produce a dynamic, controlled vocabulary that can be applied to all eukaryotes even as knowledge of gene and protein roles in cells is accumulating and changing. To this end, three independent ontologies accessible on the World-Wide Web (http://www.geneontology.org) are being constructed: biological process, molecular function and cellular component.},

First, we developed a framework for the classification of image descriptions by users, based on various classification methods from the literature. The classification framework distinguishes three related viewpoints on images, namely nonvisual metadata, perceptual descriptions and conceptual descriptions. For every viewpoint a set of descriptive classes and relations is specified. We used the framework in an empirical study, in which image descriptions were formulated by 30 participants. The resulting descriptions were split into fragments and categorized in the framework. The results suggest that users prefer general descriptions as opposed to specific or abstract descriptions. Frequently used categories were objects, events and relations between objects in the image.},

Semantically linking these schemas is a necessary precondition to establish interoperability between agents and services. Consequently, ontology alignment and mapping for data integration has become central to building a world-wide semantic web. The book introduces novel methods and approaches for semantic integration. In addition to developing new methods for ontology alignment, the author provides extensive explanations of up-to-date case studies. The topic of this book, coupled with the application-focused methodology, will appeal to professionals from a number of different domains.}

	to encode the names and addresses of objects on the Internet. The

	number of protocols, existing, invented for the web itself, or to
	be invented in the future. Access instructions for an individual
	object under a given protocol are encoded into forms of address string.
	Other protocols allow the use of object names of various forms. In
	order to abstract the idea of a generic object, the web needs the
	concepts of the universal set of objects, and of the universal set
	of names or addresses of objects. A Universal Resource Identifier
	(URI) is a member of this universal set of names in registered name
	spaces and addresses referring to registered protocols or name spaces.
	A Uniform Resource Locator (URL), defined elsewhere, is a form of
	URI which expresses an address which maps onto an access algorithm
	using network protocols. Existing URI schemes which correspond to
	the (still mutating) concept of IETF URLs are listed here. The Uniform
	Resource Name (URN) debate attempts to define a name space (and presumably
	resolution protocols) for persistent object names. This area is not
	addressed by this document, which is written in order to document
	existing practice and provide a reference point for URL and URN discussions.},

	Current user interfaces for browsing RDF data are reviewed.We argue
	that browsing tasks require both a facet browser's ability to select

	browser's ability to navigate anywhere in a dataset.We describe Humboldt
	which combines these two features in a single coherent interface.Our
	approach is based on the operation of \emph{pivoting}, which enables
	the user to move the focus of a browsing from one set of resources
	to a set of related resources.With repeated use of the pivot operation
	the user can browse anywhere in the data.We describe a preliminary
	evaluation of our approach and discuss its implications for further
